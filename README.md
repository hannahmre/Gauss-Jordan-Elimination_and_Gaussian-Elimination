# Gauss-Jordan-Elimination_and_Gaussian-Elimination
Implemented Gauss-Jordan Elimination algorithm and Gaussian Elimination algorithm to solve for a systems of equations. 
I use Gauss-Jordan to compute the inverse of an invertible matrix. 
I also use Gaussian to compute the determinant of a matrix.
